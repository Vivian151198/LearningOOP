## Interface?
. Complete/ fully abstraction! It forces the concrete classes to implement all abstract method.
List interface <-- ArrayList


## Selenium have 2 big Interface:
- Web driver()
- 

## Interface && Abstraction
1. Same:
- If want to abstract group member having closely relation, having some general method => Both Interface (default is public abstract method) and 
Abstract (need to declare abstract method) can solve
- If want to implement 1 method but all class don't have closely relation

Ex: having 2 class Bird() and Human(), having 1 general method is communicate()
And having 1 method is flyAble() => only bird implement.
=> So, if you want to provide behavior ability for a lot of objects => Using Interface
- Đa thừa kế (cho phép thừa kế những behavior ở trong nó và cho phép đi implement)
