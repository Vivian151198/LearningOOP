1. Given a string s consisting of words and spaces, return the length of the last word in the string.

A word is a maximal
substring
consisting of non-space characters only.
Example 1:

Input: s = "Hello World"
Output: 5
Explanation: The last word is "World" with length 5.
Example 2:

Input: s = "   fly me   to   the moon  "
Output: 4
Explanation: The last word is "moon" with length 4.
Example 3:

Input: s = "luffy is still joyboy"
Output: 6
Explanation: The last word is "joyboy" with length 6.


Constraints:

1 <= s.length <= 104
s consists of only English letters and spaces ' '.
There will be at least one word in s.
2. Given an integer columnNumber, return its corresponding column title as it appears in an Excel sheet.

For example:

A -> 1
B -> 2
C -> 3
...
Z -> 26
AA -> 27
AB -> 28
...

Example 1:

Input: columnNumber = 1
Output: "A"
Example 2:

Input: columnNumber = 28
Output: "AB"
Example 3:

Input: columnNumber = 701
Output: "ZY"


Constraints:

1 <= columnNumber <= 231 - 1

3. Given two non-negative integers, num1 and num2 represented as string, return the sum of num1 and num2 as a string.

You must solve the problem without using any built-in library for handling large integers (such as BigInteger). You must also not convert the inputs to integers directly.



Example 1:

Input: num1 = "11", num2 = "123"
Output: "134"
Example 2:

Input: num1 = "456", num2 = "77"
Output: "533"
Example 3:

Input: num1 = "0", num2 = "0"
Output: "0"


Constraints:

1 <= num1.length, num2.length <= 104
num1 and num2 consist of only digits.
num1 and num2 don't have any leading zeros except for the zero itself.
