Assignment: Date Calculator

You are required to implement a Date Calculator application in Java. The application should allow the user to perform various operations on dates, such as calculating the difference between two dates, adding or subtracting days from a given date, and determining the day of the week for a specific date.

Requirements:

Implement a class called DateCalculator with the following functionalities:

A method to calculate the difference in days between two given dates.
A method to add or subtract a specified number of days from a given date.
A method to determine the day of the week for a specific date.
The DateCalculator class should handle date inputs in the format "YYYY-MM-DD" (e.g., "2023-06-17").

Ensure that the DateCalculator class is properly encapsulated and follows object-oriented principles.

Write a separate Main class that demonstrates the functionality of the DateCalculator class. Instantiate the DateCalculator object and perform various operations on dates by calling its methods.

Display the results of the calculations clearly to the user.

Implement proper error handling for invalid date inputs or any other exceptional scenarios.

Add comments to your code to explain the functionality of the classes and methods.

Optional Challenges (for extra credit):

Implement additional functionalities, such as finding the difference in years or months between two dates.
Create a method to validate if a given date is a leap year.
Implement a method to calculate the number of weekdays between two dates (excluding weekends).
