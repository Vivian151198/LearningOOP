Implement a Library Management System using Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

Description:
You are tasked with creating a Library Management System using OOP principles. The system should allow users to perform various operations
such as adding books, searching for books, borrowing books, returning books, and displaying the available books in the library.

Instructions:

Create a class called "Book" with the following attributes: title, author, publication year, and availability status.
Create a class called "Library" which will serve as the main class for the library management system. This class should have the following methods:
add_book(): Allows the librarian to add a new book to the library.
search_book(): Takes a book title as input and searches for the book in the library.
borrow_book(): Takes a book title as input and allows a user to borrow the book if it is available.
return_book(): Takes a book title as input and allows a user to return a borrowed book.
display_books(): Displays all the available books in the library.
Implement appropriate data structures (such as lists or dictionaries) to store and manage the books in the library.
Use appropriate OOP principles such as encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction to design your classes and methods.
Write a program that utilizes the Library class to simulate the library management system. The program should display a 
menu with options for each operation
(add book, search book, etc.) and prompt the user for input to perform the selected operation. The program should continue running 
until the user chooses to exit.
